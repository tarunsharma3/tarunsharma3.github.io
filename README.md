# Overview

Does the title intrigue you?
Consider following processes:
1. Fractional Distillation of Crude Oil
2. Sedimentation of Dirty water using Alum
3. Fourier Transform to separate constituent frequencies
4. Using a magnet in waste segregation to attract ferrous elements.

Do you observe something common among these processes taken from diverse domains?
Well, all these processes are separating out a mixture into its constituents that are meaningful to us.

This blog is a pursuit by me to decouple the concept from implementation for large-scale data processing technologies and other emerging technologies.

## What to Expect?

These articles shall give a "tip-of-the-iceberg" kind of introduction to some concise and elegant programming paradigms and solutions to some real-world problem. At the end of each exercise you should have gained reasonable grasp on **"Problem Modelling"**, **"Survey of Candidate Solutions"**, **"Solution Design and Implementation"** pertaining to the real-world problem addressed by that exercise. This is discussed in detail in the [link](articles/phases-of-prob-solve.md).

## Style of Writing?

Ocassionally I shall be taking help of some analogies drawn from our day-to-day life. This acts as a better memory aid and is more relatable problem we are trying to solve.

Motivation for this, stems from my personal observation that, my enthusiasm levels are high when we are presented with "word problems" compared to "plain formula testing questions".

For instance, consider following question: "A Kite flyer wishes to know the height of the kite above the ground. He knows that 1000 metres of thread is being dispensed so far, and the angle subtended from ground is 45 degrees."
*Solution:* Apply trigonometry formula to calculate height
= Hypotenuse x sin (theta)
= 1000 x sin(45 degree)
= 707 metres (approx.)
